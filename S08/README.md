**ch8:** Static and dynamic graph model execution time 

- Use timeit package to meause execution time of graph models
- Use tf.function to define istatic graph in tensorflow 2 (two ways)
- Define a simpe sequentioal model (inhereted from tf.keras.model base class)
- Difne a flaten layer for input
- Define a dense layer with 'relu' activation
- Define dropout layer with 
- Define dense output layer 
- Define a call for model
- Data normalization
- Define a dynamic graph from defined graph model
- Define a static from defined graph model by tf.function
- Call timeit to measue dynamic graph model (eager) execution time
- Call timeit to measue static graph model execution time
- Output shows that graph time is less that eager time
