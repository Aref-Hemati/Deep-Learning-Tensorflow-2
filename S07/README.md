**chap7:** Recurrent neural network
sample: LSTM for Text Classification

- import dataset from Keras
- preprocessing data by Keras preprocessing
- Define a sequential deep neural network
- Define vectorization data by word embedding (as a layer)
- Define two bidirectional LSTM layer 
- Define a dense layer as an output layer by 'sigmoid' activation
- Define 'Adam' as an optimizer
- Compile model with defined optimizer and 'binary_crossentropy' loss function  and accuracy metrics
- train model with epochs and set validation data
- evaluate the model by test data
