**chap7:** DCGAN in Tensorflow 2 on fashion MNist Dataset
sample: LSTM for Text Classification

- Define sie of noise vector
- Load fashion MNist dataset
- Data normalization
- Use tf. data API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces
- The method shuffles the samples in the dataset. The buffer_size is the number of samples which are randomized and returned as tf
-
